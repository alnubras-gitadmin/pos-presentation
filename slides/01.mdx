To ensure secure access to the POS system, the authentication flow starts by checking if a user is already logged in.  
If not, they're redirected to a centralized login portal **(login.alnubras.co)**.  
After entering credentials, an additional layer of security via **2FA (OTP or TOTP)** is enforced.

Once verified, the user is redirected to the main POS dashboard **(pos.alnubras.co)** where their actions are logged.  
All backend activity is protected by a **middleware layer** that verifies and logs user identity for every operation.

**This flow ensures:**

- ✅ Only authorized users access the system  
- 🧾 All operations are traceable to specific users  
- 🛡️ Compliance with modern security and audit standards
